# SVG And Draw.io Diagrams

Use this reference for mechanism diagrams, conceptual models, workflow charts, system architecture, use-case diagrams, module diagrams, data-flow diagrams, and code-backed thesis diagrams.

## SVG Mechanism Or Concept Figures

Use SVG when the figure needs precise academic shapes, arrows, layers, equations, labels, or mechanisms.

Rules:

- Use semantic grouping.
- Keep dimensions stable with a `viewBox`.
- Use vector text when labels must remain editable.
- Keep colour palettes restrained and colour-blind aware.
- Use line endings, arrowheads, and labels consistently.
- Place bilingual labels only when required and avoid crowded dual-language text.
- Avoid decorative complexity that reduces academic readability.

Validation:

- SVG opens.
- Text fits and does not overlap.
- Arrowheads and labels are consistent.
- The visual claim matches manuscript evidence.
- Source file remains editable.

## Draw.io Engineering Diagrams

Use Draw.io for:

- workflow and process diagrams;
- system architecture;
- runtime workflow;
- use-case diagrams;
- module design;
- data-flow and storage diagrams;
- code-backed thesis diagrams.

Rules:

- Base nodes and edges on real repository behavior or user-confirmed design.
- Use one page per diagram topic.
- Prefer uncompressed Draw.io XML when generating files for easier review.
- Keep page names close to manuscript subsection names.
- Avoid services, databases, or modules that do not exist.
- Keep in-diagram text limited to labels and essential annotations; move captions, titles, long explanations, operation notes, and draft comments outside the canvas.
- Preserve user-edited Draw.io styling unless the user or plan explicitly requests a redraw.
- For code-backed diagrams, cite files, modules, routes, tables, functions, configs, or scripts that justify major nodes and edges in the final note.

## Caption And Integration

For each diagram, provide:

```text
Source file:
Export file:
Caption draft:
Placement recommendation:
Evidence/code trace:
Manual checks:
Unresolved assumptions:
